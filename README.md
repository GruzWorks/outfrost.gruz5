# Project Thunderbolt
Find publicly accessible power sockets in your city!

Authors: [Iwo Bujkiewicz][Github Outfrost], Bartosz Rodziewicz

The program started as a project at the University.

It will be the map of public places with public accessible power sockets to charge your phone or laptop.

It's in very early stage of development... And probably dropped.
